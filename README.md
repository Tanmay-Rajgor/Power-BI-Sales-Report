Hello I am Tanmay,

I have created this sales report with the help of "Leila Gharani" youtube channel. 
from this I learned following things:
1. How to import text/csv and excel data to powerbi.
2. how to tranform data. tranforming data is very important when we import the data to powerbi.
3. how to merge and split columns.
4. how to separate columns using delineter.
5. how to look for relationship between tables, powerbi is smart enough to create automatically for us.
6. how to use different visuals according to data and settings of various visuals, in this sales report i have used "clustered bar chart", "filled map", "slicer", "table","line chart" and "card".
7. learned about quick measure, time intelligence.
8. and at the end got a brief introduction about DAX and PowerQuery.
excited to dive deep...

Thanks
